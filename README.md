Differential expression analysis using R
Differential expression analysis is a crucial step in understanding how gene expression differs between conditions (e.g., healthy vs. diseased, or treated vs. untreated) in RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. This analysis identifies genes that show statistically significant differences in expression levels between the two or more conditions.
